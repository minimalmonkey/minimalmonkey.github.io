Ever since I was a kid I’ve been drawn to the New York, probably because it’s so romanticised in American films. However, it wasn’t until the end of last year that I finally made a trip over to the Big Apple to visit some friends, one of which had recently started work at [Fi](http://www.f-i.com/).

I’ve known about Fi for many years due to the amount of awards they have won and the brilliant work they continuously produce. More recently they have started to focus on creating cool HTML5 stuff and have amazing clients like [Google](http://www.f-i.com/work/google/googles-20-things) and [HTC](http://www.f-i.com/htc/global/). So I thought while I was over in NY I’d send them my CV and see if I could wangle a position there. Much to my delight, they gave me a job! A big thanks must go to my mates [Chris Sainsbury](http://www.idrawboxes.com/) and [Darcy Clarke](http://darcyclarke.me/) for passing on my CV and getting me through the door for an interview.

I’m very excited about joining such a great company and working with some great developers. I’m due to fly out and start my new job in mid March so I have a few weeks to relax (and maybe do a bit of coding!) If you’re a reader of the site and live in the city please send over an email, it would be great to hear from you.

I also want to say a huge thanks to [Specialmoves](http://www.specialmoves.com/) who I left in pursuit of the “American dream”. It really is a great company and even though I was only there for a relatively short time I learnt loads and made some great friends. I’m sad to be leaving such a great company prematurely, but really excited about my new adventure with Fi in New York.
